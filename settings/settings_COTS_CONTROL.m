% YM 07/25: now defining the region where CoTS control is deployed (region names to match 'New_regions_TS.mat').
% With 4 regions, a total of 15 geographic domains can be defined, including the previous stategies #1 (GBR-wide) to #8 (only South). 
% Note this also enables other stategies (#9 to #18) to perform in a specific geographic context (i.e., GBR-wide vs other specified domains)
% If only a subset of reefs if selected for simulation, make sure to specify the corresponding region, otherwise no reef might be visited.

% Choose culling strategy (detail in f_makeReefList_NEW)
META.COTS_reefs2cull_strat = 1;
% 1 - GBRMPA strategy that goes to Target reefs first, then Priority reefs, then Non Priority reefs
% 9 - Outbreak front (latitude): GBRMPA strategy that goes to Target reefs first, then also goes to 0.5° lat (~50 km) from target reefs with outbreaks - whole GBR.
% 10 - Outbreak front (sector): look for the AIMS sector (1-11) that has the highest density of COTS on ALL reefs, start control there, then remaining.
% 11 - Outbreak front (sector/priority): look for the AIMS sector (1-11) that has the highest proportion of PRIORITY reefs with outbreaks, start control there, then remaining.
% 12 - Connectivity-based: effort sink - at each timestep, still make priority reef list same as before but don't include reefs that have COTS > 3 per tow at that timestep.
% 13 - Connectivity/coral-based: effort sink with coral cover minimum - at each timestep, still make priority reef list same as before but don't include reefs that have COTS > 3 per tow at that timestep unless they have > threshold coral cover.
% 14 - Protection status: at each timestep, still make priority reef list etc but only include green zone reefs.
% 15 - Protection status: at each timestep, still make priority reef list etc but don't include any green zone reefs.
% 16 - GreenZone weighting with CoTS connectivity and coral cover.
% 17 - BlueZone weighting with CoTS connectivity and coral cover.
% 18 - CoTS connec and coral cover, same as case 16 and 17 above, but no preferential weighting to blue or green zones.
