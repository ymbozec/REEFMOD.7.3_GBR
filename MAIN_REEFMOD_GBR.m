% REEFMOD-GBR MAIN SCRIPT, version 7.3
% Yves-Marie Bozec, y.bozec@uq.edu.au (Mar 2025 - Nov 2025)
%
% Extensive revision of CoTS control (f_COTS_control_NEW) with correct conversion CoTS density <-> per tow and correct
% calculation of culled density relative to the ecological threshold. Also revised entirely the computation of priority
% reef lists (makeReefList_NEW) with contracted and optimsed code. 
% CoTS control records now stored in 'RECORD' instead of 'RESULT'.
%
% Added size-specific background mortality for corals (mortality decreasing with size). 
%
% New calibration of coral stock-recruitment (beta parameter) under new assumption for the default fertilisation success
% FS = 0.4 when Allee effects is OFF (consistent with the maximum FS when Allee effects is ON).
% Allee effects in coral fertilisation is OFF by default.
% 
% Refined the selection of dispersal model for coral and CoTS (settings_CONNECTIVITY_NEW_2) with a dedicated CONNECT
% structure array for coral and another for CoTS. Connectivity matrices now averaged over multiple spawning events 
% of the same year to optimise storage and standardise across dispersal models.
% Recommended settings (default): 
% -> GBR1 for coral (but can be swapped back to GBR4 without modifying BH_alpha/BH_beta). 
% -> GBR4 for CoTS; GBR1 is available but not recommended. GBRLUP also available but requires new parametrisation of
% CoTS mortality, BH_alpha and BH_beta (ongoing work by Suki).
% Also refined the tracking of sequence of connectivity matrices (in META.connectivity and RECORD). 
% 
% Outputs now compiled and formatted in a dedicated script (FORMAT_OUTPUTS) which is run at the end of MAIN_REEFMOD.
% Outputs can be produced either for each seasonal step (6 months) or yearly (choice to be set in format_extract).
